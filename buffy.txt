Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans are sure to get their fix with the DVD
release of the show's first season. The three-disc collection
includes all 12 episodes as well as many extras. There is a collection
of interviews by the show's creator Joss Whedon in which he
explains his inspiration for the show as well as comments on the
various cast members. Much of the same material is covered in more
depth with Whedon's commentary track for the show's first two
episodes that make up the Buffy the Vampire Slayer pilot. The most
interesting points of Whedon's commentary come from his explanation
of the learning curve he encountered shifting from blockbuster films
like Toy Story to a much lower-budget television series. The first
disc also includes a short interview with David Boreanaz who plays the
role of Angel. Other features include the script for the pilot
episodes, a trailer, a large photo gallery of publicity shots and
in-depth biographies of Whedon and several of the show's stars, including
Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alyson Hannigan and Nicholas Brendon.
